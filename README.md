# Chromatin as a biomarker for breast cancer progression

Tumor initiation and progression is driven by both intracellular changes within the tumor cells as well as the biophysical properties of the tumor microenvironment. Here we measure nuclear morphology and chromatin organization to characterize the spatial chromatin organization at the single cell level during tumor progression. To gain further insights into the alterations in the local tissue microenvironments, we also compute the nuclear orientations to identify mechanically coupled spatial neighbourhoods that have been posited to drive tumor progression.

Below is a graphical summary of the features used to measure chromatin architecture.
